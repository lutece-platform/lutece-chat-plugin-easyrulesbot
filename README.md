##Introduction

This plugin provides a chat bot engine based on the rules engine [EasyRules](https://github.com/EasyRules/easyrules) .

Bots can be made by simply configure rules into a separate Lutece module : `module-easyrulesbot-mybot` .

See the [online demo](http://dev.lutece.paris.fr/incubator/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?page=bot) of a bot that helps you to create a pom.xml in order to build a Lutece web site.

#Configuration

All the rules configuration should be defined into the Spring context file of the bot module.

Bot rules are specialized EasyRules rules.

They inherit fields such as ( name, description, priority ) but have also additional fields such as ( question, response processor, response comment, conditions list, ...).Each rule has also one datakey associated that is being valuated by a response processor.

All messages can be defined either in the Spring context file or in the localized messages_*.properties using i18n keys. The second way is recommended.

##Response Processors

Some standard processors are available for commun response handling :
 
*  **InputStringResponseProcessor** : accept String to define the datakey of the rule.
*  **MultipleValuesResponseProcessor** : define the datakey of the rule among several values associated each to a list of terms.


#Usage

For Front office bots :


```

```
